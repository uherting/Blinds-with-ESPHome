# Blinds-with-ESPHome
Using home assistant and an ESPHome device to control a blind.

Initially this repository represents the solution DrZzs represents in his video [Motorize and Wifi Control your Existing Blinds - Version2 | Smart Home | Home Assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlPhKSdI5co).

As soon time and motivation allows I would like to introduce additions.
